<h2>WZ GRL</h2>
<p>A place to search up your recent games and stats on Warzone. When on the home page, you are asked to select which platform you'd like to search your stats on. Then type in your gamertag, and click search. A summary from the past 20 games will pop up along with two other buttons. One button will pin that user and add it to another page, and the other button will take you to view more detail on the previous 20 games. allow![Screen Shot 2021-09-12 at 6 33 47 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84594956/133006417-c31a7337-e3a1-4ff9-af70-49eed9c39356.png)

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Warzone is one of my favorite games to play at the moment and is being played by many people. I thought it would be fun to create my own vision of a stat tracker for Warzone. On this website, you are also given the capability of pinning your friends and comparing your performance to theirs (a little friendly competition).</p>
